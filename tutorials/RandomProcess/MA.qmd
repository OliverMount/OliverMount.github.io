# Moving Average (MA) process

The YW equation for MA(1) process can be obtained by setting all the $a(l)$ in YW equation to zero for ARMA(p,q) and noting that h(n)=b(n), the finite impulse response filter.

$$ 
 C(k)  =  \sigma_v^2 \sum_{l=0}^{q-k} b(l+k) b^*(l)~ \forall k
$$

Since the FIR filter is causal we have $h(n)=0, n<0$. The above equation can be written as

$$ 
 C(k)  =  \sigma_v^2 \sum_{l=0}^{q-|k|} b(l+|k|) b^*(l)~ \forall k
$$

Then the YW equation for the MA(q) process is

$$ 
 r_x(k)  =  \sigma_v^2 \sum_{l=0}^{q-|k|} b(l+|k|) b^*(l)~~~~ \forall k
$$

but $r_x(k)$ is non-zero for $k \in [-q,q]$. Thus, the autocorrelation of MA(q) process is totally determined by the autocorrelation of filter coefficients that generates the process.
