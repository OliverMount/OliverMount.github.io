# Random processes {#rp}

A list of random processes we discuss in this tutorial are

1.  ARMA

2.  AR

3.  MA

4.  Harmonic processes

Except the harmonic processes, the random processes are obtained by filtering white noise via linear time-invariant filter with rational transfer function given by

$$
H(z) =\frac{B(z)}{A(z)} =  \frac{\sum_{k=0}^qb(k)z^{-k}}{1+\sum_{k=1}^pa(k)z^{-k}}
$$
