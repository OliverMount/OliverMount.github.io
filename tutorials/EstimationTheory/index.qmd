# Introduction

The central problem in estimation theory is that given a set of observations $\{y_1, y_2,\cdots , y_N \}$ that depends on the parameter(s) $\bm{\theta} = \theta_1, \theta_2,\cdots, \theta_N$, determine the parameters as a function of the functions. Mathematically,

$$
\bm{\hat{\theta}} = g(y_1, y_2,\cdots , y_N)
$$
