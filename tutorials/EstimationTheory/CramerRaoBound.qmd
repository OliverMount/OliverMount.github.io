# Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB)

The **Cramer-Rao Lower Bound** (CRLB) is a fundamental concept in estimation theory. It provides a theoretical lower bound on the variance of any `unbiased estimator of a deterministic parameter.` This bound is derived using the Fisher information and is widely used to assess the efficiency of estimators.

The **Bayesian Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (BCRLB)** is an extension of the classical Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) to Bayesian estimation problems. Unlike the classical CRLB, which applies to deterministic parameters, the BCRLB is used when the parameter being estimated is treated as a random variable with a known prior distribution.

There are other bounds exists.
