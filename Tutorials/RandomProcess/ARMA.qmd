# Auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) processess

Let $x(n)$ and $v(n)$ are stationary random processes. If they are related by the linear constant coefficient differential equations

$$
x(n) + \sum_{l=1}^{p} a(l) x(n-l)  = \sum_{l=0}^q b_q(l)v(n-l)
$$

then $x(n)$ is called an ARMA(p,q) process.
