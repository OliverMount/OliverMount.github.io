# Auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) processess

Let $x(n)$ and $v(n)$ are stationary random processes. If they are related by the linear constant coefficient differential equations

$$
x(n) + \sum_{l=1}^{p} a(l) x(n-l)  = \sum_{l=0}^q b(l)v(n-l)
$$

then $x(n)$ is called an ARMA(p,q) process.

#### Autocorrelation

On both sides, multiplying by $x^*(n-k)$ and taking the expectation $\mathbb{E}$ leads to

$$
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}[x(n)x^*(n-k)] + \sum_{l=1}^{p} a(l) E[x(n-l) x^*(n-k)] & = \sum_{l=0}^q b(l)E[v(n-l)x^*(n-k)] \\
r_x(k) + \sum_{l=1}^{p} a(l) r_x(k-l) & = \sum_{l=0}^q b(l)r_{vx}(k-l)
\end{split}

In the present form, @eq-arma_original is not useful. It would be nice to relate the cross-correlation term $r_{vx}(k)$ on the RHS of @eq-arma_original to the
