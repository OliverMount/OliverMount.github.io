The acronym "nrnivmodl" stands for **NEURON Interpreter and Model Description Language Compiler**. It is part of the NEURON simulation environment and is used to compile `.mod` files (written in NMODL) into a specialized version of NEURON called `special`. This version includes user-defined mechanisms for simulating physiological neuron models

## Core Blocks in NMODL

The `RANGE` and `GLOABAL` names should also be declared in the normal `PARAMETER` or `ASSIGNED` statement outside of the `NEURON` block, otherwise they will be hidden from the user.

*NEURON* makes the distinction between mechanisms that are attributed to an entire section (`e.g., HH channels`) and mechanisms that are associated with a particular point in the section (`e.g., voltage clamp or synapse`). While the former are most conveniently expressed in terms of per unit area, the point processes are more conveniently expressed in absolute terms (e.g., current injection is usually expressed in terms of nA instead of nA/cm^2^). Point processes also differ in that you can insert several in the same segment.
