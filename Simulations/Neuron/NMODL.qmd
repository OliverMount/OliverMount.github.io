The acronym "nrnivmodl" stands for **NEURON Interpreter and Model Description Language Compiler**. It is part of the NEURON simulation environment and is used to compile `.mod` files (written in NMODL) into a specialized version of NEURON called `special`. This version includes user-defined mechanisms for simulating physiological neuron models

## Core Blocks in NMODL

The `RANGE` and `GLOABAL` names should also be declared in the normal `PARAMETER` or `ASSIGNED` statement outside of the `NEURON` block, otherwise they will be hidden from the user.
