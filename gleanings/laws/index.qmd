## Kidlin's Law (origin unknown)

**If you can write down a problem clearly, you've already solved half of it**.‚Äù Writing is a powerful tool for problem-solving, because writing is thinking. You cannot write clearly if you aren't thinking clearly.

## Pareto law

What is the 80 20 rule in psychology?

It is also known as the Pareto law, and as the principle of least effort. It states that **a surprisingly small proportion of efforts and inputs (20%) lead to 80% of our results**. In other words, there is an extremely lopsided distribution of inputs and outcomes.
